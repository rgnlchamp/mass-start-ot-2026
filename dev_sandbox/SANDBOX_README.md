# Live Update Test Sandbox

This directory is an isolated copy of the main application.
Use this to test the live update features without affecting the production site.

## How to Run Locally
1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to run the local server.

## How to Deploy
Run `vercel` in this directory.
**IMPORTANT**: When asked "Link to existing project?", select **No**.
Give it a new name like `mass-start-sandbox`.
This will give you a completely separate live URL to share and test.
