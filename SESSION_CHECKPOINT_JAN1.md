# Session Checkpoint - Jan 1, 2026

## Current State
The application has been updated with the following key changes:

### 1. Dashboard Refinements
- **Removed "Key Dates & Timeline"**: Decluttered the dashboard by removing the large timeline component.
- **Font Size Increase**: Significantly increased font sizes for the "Qualification Guide" (Three Pathways) and "Team Size Limit" sections to improve readability.
- **Layout**: "Qualification Guide" remains at the top, followed by the "Olympic Team Tracker" and the "Detailed Quota Breakdown".

### 2. Rules & Info Page
- **Timeline Moved**: The "Key Dates & Timeline" component was successfully moved here.
- **New Section Order**:
  1. Three Pathways Visual Guide (with updated larger fonts)
  2. Official Rules & Documentation
  3. IOC & ISU Qualification Rules
  4. **Key Dates & Timeline**
  5. Detailed Quota Breakdown
- **Consistent Styling**: Font sizes for the Qualification Guide match the dashboard updates.

## Next Steps
